Lesson 10

DOM
- It's a set of specifications
- Based on HTML elements, which semi-map to nodes
- JavaScript can change the DOM, like when you open a menu

Web Accessibility
- Check the WAI site
- Screen reader
  - Mac: CMD+f5
  - nvaccess.org


A11y Technical implementation
- Screenreader-only content (extra info about links and navigation, like skip links)
  you want to hide it visually but make it appear for screenreaders.
  - Option 1:
  .hidden {
    position: relative;
    left: -10000px;
    top: auto;
  }
  .hidden:focus {
    left: 0;
  }
  - Option 2:
  .sr-only { // Introduced by bootstrap, has come into common use
    position: absolute;
    left: -100000px;
    top: auto;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
  <p>Adopt a pet from <span class="sr-only">this link opens in a new tab</span><a href="humanesociety.org">
- Tab index
  <a href="#cats" tabindex="1">Cats</a>
  It'll go back to the beginning
  Don't do this usually
- Zooming
  Ctrl +
  If using percentages and rems to size things this should be easy to get right
- Image alt tags
  "handsome brown dog smiling in a sunny field"


Assignment
- Course project (portfolio)
  1. Changed color for better contrast, made sure it looked ok with achromatopsia emulation
  2. Changed link hover feedback to toggle the underline because the colors made it hard to see hover feedback
  3. Made image descriptions more descriptive
  4. Confirmed that each page is readable at 200% zoom
  5. Confirmed the site could be navigated using NVDA
  6. Confirmed that it was readable using the browser tools colorblindness sim
- Architecture project (archery)
  1. Darkened the header to make the contrast with the white text easier to read
  2. Added "Home" to make the page title more descriptive
  3. Updated image descriptions
  4. Added a transcript for the video in a linked .txt file

  - Captioned the photos
  - Check the zoom
  - Check color blindness sim
  - Make nav skippable
  - Describe link content


Accessibility implementation Slideshow
- Contrast between text and background color should be 4.5:1 for
normal-sized text, 3:1 for large text.
Contrast checker tool (for hex value colors):
hDp://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

- Every form input should have a corresponding label, correctly
connected to it.

- > Color blindness simulator:
https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/

- > Clickable elements are large, have space between them.

- Make nav skippable: Screen reader users don’t want to listen to a lot of nav links. If
there are many nav items, provide a (hidden) link to skip to
main content.

- Screen reader only content:
Bootstrap provides the “sr-only” class. Any content tagged
with it will be hidden visually but made available to screen
readers.
> You can recreate this funcJonality very easily by using media
queries, custom styling, or aria labels.
> hDps://accessible360.com/accessible360-blog/use-aria-labelscreen-reader-text/

- Skip focus on items that aren't actually clickable
  <nav>…</nav>
  <a	name	="content"	tabindex="-1">x</a>
  <h2>Welcome	to	Site!</h2>
Otherwise don't manually set tab index on page items

- Meaningfully describe content of links

- Zoomable to 200% without breaking page layout

- Descriptive, Unique page titles

- Image alt: good description for important images, a blank string for purely decorative images

- Headings are the signposts of the DOM tree

- SEO and A11y both benefit from clear, accurate labeling and
organization of informaJon. Luckily, that’s just what HTML is
good at!
