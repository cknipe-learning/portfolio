Lesson 3: CSS

Video 3: Pseudoclasses and attribute selectors
- Pseudoclasses: selectors on state, like "is user hovering over this" or some attribute
- If HTML is
  <a href="https://blah.com/">Whatever text</a>
  then the selector looks like
  a[href="https://blah.com/"] {
    background-color: blue;
  }

Video 4: Colors
-  www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.html
- rgba(r, g, b, a[0-1])
- hsla()
  - hue 0-360
  - saturation percentage (0 gray; 0 full color)
  - lightness percentage (0 black; 100 white)
  - alpha 0-1

Video 5: Borders
- Want to use relative units of measurements instead of px when dealing with larger stuff
  Like:
  p.important {
    width: 75%
  }
- Units of measurements: Pixels, percentages, and REM (relative to font-size of root element)
- Prefer to set just width (not both width and height)

Video 6: Precedence rules
- Inspecting the elements under Elements > Computed tab. See which style is triumphing
- Whenever styles are being applied in a way that doesn't make sense, check in the browser DevTools for conflicts.
- Basic selector precedence:
  - element < class < id
  - more specific
  - later in the css file

Video: External style sheet
- styles.css in styles folder
- in <head> add <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/styles.css">

Video: Hosting with GitHub Pages
- GitHub hosting is free
- FTP: not as common anymore
1. Email
2. index.html in root
3. Push to github repo
4. Enable Pages in github settings

- Can set up custom urls - talk to your instructor directly or look it up
- It can take a few minutes. Hard-reload if it takes longer. You may need to clear the cache (Tools > History > Clear browsing data... > Cached images and files)
