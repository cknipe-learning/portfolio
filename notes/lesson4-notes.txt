Lesson 4 notes

Video 4a.1: Box model
- Huh, it sounded like at one point she said you usually use px as units for sizing, but then later said "this is just for debugging, we'd never really use pixels" -- is that just for setting a height attribute, or is pixels not commonly used?

- * { box-sizing: border-box }
  - Box-sizing: border-box should be boilerplate, most projects will have this on all stylesheets. Double check you have this set.
  - * is a selector for all things -- not commonly used
  - What does it do? -- it makes height/width control the WHOLE element including content, padding, and border combined. Without it, height/width control only the content.

Video 4b.1: CSS Positioning
- "Normal flow"
- position: static
  - Default; element is placed where it would be in the normal flow. Top/right/bottom/left have no effect

- position: relative
  - Element is positioned relative to its normal position but offset by top/right/bottom/left
  - Not removed from normal flow of the page

- position: absolute
  - Position it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
  - Is removed from the flow of the page. Other elements will act like it doesn't exist, so stuff can overlap

- position: fixed
  - Positioned relative to the browser window; will remain when page is scrolled
  - Is removed, can overlap

- z-index: control order of elements. Only works with positioned elements.


Video 4b.2: Float
- Can make scrollbars, magazine style
- Elements can only be floated left or right (all the way l or r to the containing element)
- With content-box set to float: right, the boxes, they float as right as they can without bumping each other
  Footer is pretending like the floated boxes don't exist.
  To change that, use clear: right on the footer
- To fix the footer another way,
  Could instead add
  .clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    display: block;
    clear: both;
  }
  and make <section class="clearfix">content</section>
- Overflow
  - Visible: Default, usually not ideal. Content can leak out of containing element
  - Auto: Probably gives element a scrollbar to not burst out of containing element
  - Hidden: Crop, hide extra content. Best for images, not text
  - Scroll: Gives the element a scrollbar, whether you need it or not (dislike this one)
